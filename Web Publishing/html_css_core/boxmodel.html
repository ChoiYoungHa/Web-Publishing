       <p class="p5">These are the fundamental social skills required for living successfully.
       But while intellect is an asset with a strong genetic basis, thinking well is also a skill that
       can be learned. And part of thinking well is ‘thinking before you speak’.
       Why ‘think before you speak’? Because while most of us are pretty careless with the words we choose,
       words are just so powerful. They can be helpful or hurtful, and can have a direct influence on the outcome of a situation,
       creating a positive or negative reaction in our world. Words define our identity and reveal our attitudes and sensitivities, reflecting who we are. Our choice of words gives listeners an indication of our intelligence or ignorance.  And when continually reinforced and turned into habitually negative thought patterns, they have the power to create a bad habit of dwelling on the negatives in life.
       The problem is, once words exit our mouth, no amount of apologies will make them magically go back in: blurting something out and then trying to retract it is like shutting the gate after the horse has bolted.  On the other hand, thinking before we speak allows us the time to consider the effect of the words we are choosing.</p>
